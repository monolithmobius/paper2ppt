Note: Github id gabrinawu and monolithmobius are all my own account, gabrinawu is my old account linked to github desktop and pycharm. I registered this new account monolithmobius here but when i push the work gabrinawu is attached as the contributor. 
 
 neat.py is the final usable work
 
 try.py is the ongoing experimental code
